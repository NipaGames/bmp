# BMP
A simple C++ program for creating BMP image files from 2D pixel arrays.

## Compiling
**Use run.bat to compile.**\
At the moment compiling only works on Windows.

Requirements:
- GCC with C++17
- CCache (optional, you could change ``CC`` in Makefile)
- Make

I highly recommend using MinGW, I haven't tested on any other platforms.
